ZEngine

ZEngine is 2D game engine based on top of SFML (with an idea of abstraction, which will next lead to the possibility of using another low-level library).

The engine will be separated in different modules. Currently only the basic core is working.
In the future the engine will have several module based on the real need for game development (Animation, Collisions, AI, pathfinding, GUI, ...)
